# Contributing to fogwall

## Prerequisites

The easiest way to get the right toolchain versions is [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/):

```shell
mise install   # installs Java 25 (Temurin) and Node 26 as defined in mise.toml
```

Optional CLI tools (e.g. `glab`, for testing the GitLab SCM API proxy dialect) live in `mise.cli.toml` rather than
`mise.toml`, since they're not needed by every contributor. Install them with:

```shell
MISE_ENVIRONMENT=cli mise install
```

If you prefer to manage tools yourself, you need:

- Java 25+
- Node 26+
- Docker or Podman (for e2e tests and Docker Compose workflows)

Gradle itself is included via the wrapper — no separate installation needed.

## Project structure

Multi-module Gradle project; dependencies flow upward (`core` → `server` → `dashboard`):

| Module              | Purpose                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fogwall-core`      | Shared library: filter chain, JGit hooks, push store, provider model, approval abstraction |
| `fogwall-server`    | Standalone proxy-only server — no dashboard, no Spring                                     |
| `fogwall-dashboard` | Dashboard + REST API — Spring MVC, approval UI, depends on `fogwall-server`                |

See [docs/architecture/index.md](docs/architecture/index.md) for how the modules fit together at runtime.

## Build

```shell
./gradlew spotlessApply      # fix formatting (palantir-java-format) — run before build
./gradlew build              # compile + unit tests
```

Formatting is enforced in CI. Always run `spotlessApply` before pushing.

When working on Java-only changes in the dashboard module, pass `-PskipFrontend` to skip the Node/npm frontend build
steps (requires Node to be available otherwise):

```shell
./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:compileJava -PskipFrontend
./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:build -PskipFrontend
```

## Running the server locally

### Proxy only (no dashboard)

```shell
./gradlew :fogwall-server:run
```

Listens on `http://localhost:8080`. Logs go to `fogwall-server/logs/application.log`. Stop with:

```shell
./gradlew :fogwall-server:stop
```

### Dashboard + REST API

```shell
./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:run
```

Opens the approval dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/`. Stop with:

```shell
./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:stop
```

The dashboard module always uses UI-mode approval (pushes block until manually approved). The standalone server defaults
to auto-approve.

### Local config — the first thing to do after cloning

Your local configuration lives in `config/`, it is gitignored, and it is yours. Nothing in there ships in a jar or an
image, and no test reads it. Copy the examples and edit them:

```shell
cp config/fogwall-local.yml.example config/fogwall-local.yml
cp config/fogwall-dashboard.yml.example config/fogwall-dashboard.yml
```

The `run` tasks do that copy for you the first time if you skip it, and put `config/` on the runtime classpath so the
profiles resolve from there.

`fogwall-local.yml` holds providers, rules, permissions, users and scanning — the things a standalone proxy also needs.
Settings only the dashboard reads (session store, Vite CORS, issue filing, attestation questions) live in
`fogwall-dashboard.yml`; the dashboard's `run` task loads both, `local` then `dashboard`, and both take priority over
the defaults baked into the jar.

Two things to change before your first push: add your own SCM login under the `dev` user's `scm-identities`, and set the
email your commits are authored with. Without the first, identity does not resolve; without the second, the author check
refuses the push.

A profile named in `FOGWALL_CONFIG_PROFILES` with no matching file on the classpath fails startup, naming the file it
wanted. It does not fall back to defaults.

At minimum you also need an allow rule for your test repo and a permission entry for your proxy user — scoped to one
repository, not to every slug:

```yaml
rules:
  allow:
    - enabled: true
      order: 110
      operations: BOTH
      provider: github
      match:
        target: SLUG
        value: /your-org/your-repo
        type: LITERAL

permissions:
  - username: your-proxy-user
    provider: github
    match:
      target: SLUG
      value: /your-org/your-repo
      type: LITERAL
    operations: PUSH
```

See [docs/configuration/index.md](docs/configuration/index.md) for the full reference.

### Testing the SCM API listeners locally (TLS)

The SCM API listeners (`gh`, `glab`, `tea`, `fj`) can't be exercised over plain HTTP: every one of those CLIs addresses
a custom host over HTTPS with no way to ask otherwise. So fogwall has to terminate TLS, which locally means a
self-signed certificate the CLIs will trust.

Generate a small CA and a leaf signed by it. A bare `openssl req -x509` self-signed certificate is **not** enough: it is
a CA certificate, and `fj` (rustls) refuses one presented as a server certificate — `CaUsedAsEndEntity`. `gh` and `glab`
(Go) accept it, so the shortcut appears to work until you try Forgejo.

```shell
cd /tmp
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 30 -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca.pem \
  -subj "/CN=fogwall local dev CA" -addext "basicConstraints=critical,CA:TRUE"

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout fogwall-key.pem -out leaf.csr -subj "/CN=localhost"
openssl x509 -req -in leaf.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -days 30 -out leaf.pem \
  -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1\nbasicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth\n")
cat leaf.pem ca.pem > fogwall-cert.pem
```

The SAN matters too — Go rejects a certificate carrying only a CN. `-nodes` already emits a PKCS8 key, so there is no
conversion step. Run with `server.tls` pointed at the chain; every enabled SCM API listener inherits it and logs
`(https, inherited from server.tls)`:

```shell
FOGWALL_SERVER_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/tmp/fogwall-cert.pem \
FOGWALL_SERVER_TLS_KEY=/tmp/fogwall-key.pem \
  ./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:run
```

Clients then trust `ca.pem` (not the leaf) via `SSL_CERT_FILE`.

Then point a CLI at it, trusting the CA per-invocation with `SSL_CERT_FILE` (`gh` and `glab` are Go, which reads it for
the file portion of the trust store while still loading the system CA directory — so public hosts keep working):

```shell
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/tmp/ca.pem

# gh — GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN, not GH_TOKEN, which gh only applies to github.com.
# `gh auth login` can't be used here: it validates against the REST API, which fogwall doesn't proxy.
GH_HOST=localhost:9443 GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
  gh pr create -R localhost:9443/<owner>/<repo> --base main --head <branch> --title t --body b

# glab — authenticate against the fogwall host in a throwaway config dir so your real one is untouched
export GLAB_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/fogwall-glab
glab auth login --hostname localhost:9444 --api-protocol https --insecure-storage --stdin < /path/to/pat
GITLAB_HOST=localhost:9444 glab mr create -R <owner>/<repo> \
  --source-branch <branch> --target-branch main --title t --description b --no-editor --yes
```

For Gitea/Forgejo, bring up the container (`bash compose.sh -- up -d gitea`) and point both CLIs at the Gitea listener.
Each keeps its config under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, so a throwaway directory isolates them from your real logins:

```shell
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/fogwall-tea tea login add --name fogwall --url https://localhost:9445 --token "$GITEA_PAT"
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/fogwall-tea tea pr create --login fogwall --repo <owner>/<repo> --head <branch> --base main --title t

echo "$GITEA_PAT" | XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/fogwall-fj fj auth add-token -H https://localhost:9445
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/fogwall-fj fj -H https://localhost:9445 pr create "t" --body b --head <branch> --base main --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

Client quirks that cost time if you don't know them:

- `glab mr create` refuses to run unless one of the repo's git remotes points at `GITLAB_HOST` — add a dummy
  `glab-proxy-do-not-use` remote, which is never used for git.
- `glab` sends a PAT in `PRIVATE-TOKEN` but an OAuth token in `Authorization: Bearer`; the two are not interchangeable.
- `fj` must run inside a clone and needs `--repo` for most commands; `fj pr close` takes the number only.
- gitleaks discards low-entropy matches, so a made-up token like `ghp_ABCDEF…0123456789` is a false negative by design.
  Use a random one when testing content inspection.

## Tests

### Unit tests

```shell
./gradlew test
```

Unit tests live under each module's `src/test/`. They run without containers.

### E2E tests (JUnit, requires Docker/Podman)

```shell
./gradlew e2eTest
```

These start a containerised Gitea instance and a live Jetty proxy in-process. They are tagged `@Tag("e2e")` and live in
`fogwall-server/src/test/java/com/rbc/fogwall/e2e/`.

### UI regression tests (Playwright, no Docker)

```shell
cd fogwall-dashboard/frontend && npx playwright install chromium && npx playwright test
```

Specs live in `fogwall-dashboard/frontend/tests/`. The Playwright web server boots the dashboard against a **real,
pre-populated H2 database** — `tests/fixtures/fogwall.sql`, restored fresh into `build/playwright-db/` before every run
by `:fogwall-dashboard:restoreFixtureDb` — with the matching profile `tests/fixtures/fogwall-playwright.yml` put on the
classpath via `-PconfigDir`. Four local users exist (`admin`, `dev`, `reviewer`, `observer`); the `asRole` fixture in
`tests/fixtures.ts` opens a page as any of them. No credentials or network are needed on replay.

The database is produced by `test/capture/capture.py` from **real pushes through real providers** with your own tokens,
then scrubbed to stable placeholders (`fixture-dev`, `fixture-dev@example.com`, `fogwall-fixture`, …) and committed.
Push-detail specs read `tests/fixtures/manifest.json` (scenario → push id). Locally a missing scenario skips its spec,
so a partial capture is workable; **on CI a missing scenario fails the job** (`process.env.CI`), because there it means
someone dropped a scenario or forgot to re-capture.

Specs that change the status of captured push records (approve / reject / cancel through the UI) are named
`*.mutation.spec.ts` and run in the `mutations` project, which Playwright starts only after every read-only spec has
passed; the same goes for CRUD specs that add grants to fixture users. Everything else may run in parallel.

The suite runs on every PR in the `Playwright UI Tests` job; it needs no Docker, credentials, or network and takes under
a minute on top of the app boot. **Re-capture** when a hook or filter changes what it records (step names, messages,
content), when a scenario is added, or when the fixture profile changes push outcomes — commit the new `fogwall.sql` +
`manifest.json` in the same PR as the change. Config-page changes (rules, providers, groups) only need the profile
edited. See [test/capture/README.md](test/capture/README.md).

### Compose smoke tests (packaged image, requires Docker/Podman)

```shell
bash compose.sh --contributions -- up -d
./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:composeTest
```

These are black-box against the **packaged image and shipped config** — is it up, does it function, on this database and
this auth. They are tagged `@Tag("compose")`, live in
`fogwall-dashboard/src/test/java/com/rbc/fogwall/dashboard/compose/`, and attach to whatever `compose.sh` brought up
rather than starting anything themselves, so a test skips when the axis it needs is not running. One representative pass
and one representative fail per axis, never a feature matrix.

The axes, each a `compose.sh` flag:

```shell
bash compose.sh --db postgres -- up -d     # a database driver: default | postgres | mysql | mariadb | mongo
bash compose.sh --auth ldap -- up -d       # a directory identity signs in and reviews a push
bash compose.sh --otel -- up -d            # spans and metrics reach the collector
bash compose.sh --contributions -- up -d   # the SCM API listeners, over TLS (run test/make-certs.sh first)
bash compose.sh --ssh -- up -d             # fogwall's git-over-SSH transport on 2222
```

CI runs `composeTest` in a matrix — one leg per database plus `ldap` and `otel` — against the image built once and
loaded into each leg. Anything finer-grained than an axis (per-scanner cases, rule-match permutations) belongs in the
unit and e2e suites, which prove it more cheaply.

## Docker Compose (local Gitea)

The Compose setup runs fogwall against a local Gitea instance. Overlay files are independent mixins — one for the auth
provider, one for the database backend. They can be combined freely.

### Overlay files

**Auth overlays** — each mounts a different `fogwall-local.yml` config into the container:

| File                             | Auth provider                      | Default database |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| _(none)_                         | Static (password hashes in config) | H2 in-memory     |
| `docker/docker-compose.ldap.yml` | OpenLDAP                           | H2 in-memory     |
| `docker/docker-compose.oidc.yml` | OIDC (mock-oauth2-server)          | H2 in-memory     |

**Database overlays** — each sets `FOGWALL_DATABASE_*` environment variables; no config file swap needed:

| File                                 | Backend      | Profile flag         | UI                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| _(none)_                             | H2 in-memory | —                    | —                      |
| `docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml` | PostgreSQL   | `--profile postgres` | Adminer at :8082       |
| `docker/docker-compose.mysql.yml`    | MySQL        | `--profile mysql`    | Adminer at :8082       |
| `docker/docker-compose.mariadb.yml`  | MariaDB      | `--profile mariadb`  | Adminer at :8082       |
| `docker/docker-compose.mongo.yml`    | MongoDB      | `--profile mongo`    | Mongo Express at :8081 |

**Observability overlay** — turns fogwall's OpenTelemetry export on and adds the full telemetry stack (collector, Jaeger
for traces, Prometheus + Grafana for metrics):

| File                             | What it adds                                                    | Flag     | UIs                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker/docker-compose.otel.yml` | OTel Collector, Jaeger (traces), Prometheus + Grafana (metrics) | `--otel` | Jaeger :16686 · Grafana :3001 (no login) · Prometheus :9091 |

Any auth overlay can be combined with any database overlay (or none, to keep H2), and `--otel` composes with all of
them. Use the `compose.sh` wrapper rather than bare `docker compose` — it assembles the right `-f`/`--profile` flags and
auto-detects docker vs podman:

```bash
bash compose.sh [--auth ldap|oidc] [--db postgres|mysql|mariadb|mongo] [--otel] -- up -d
```

### First-time setup

After starting any stack, run this once to create the Gitea admin user and test repository:

```shell
bash docker/gitea-setup.sh
```

### Common stacks

**Static auth + H2** (simplest — no external dependencies):

```shell
bash compose.sh -- up -d
```

**LDAP + H2**:

```shell
bash compose.sh --auth ldap -- up -d
```

**LDAP + PostgreSQL** (recommended for verifying IdP email locking and auto-provisioning):

```shell
bash compose.sh --auth ldap --db postgres -- up -d
```

**OIDC + PostgreSQL**:

```shell
bash compose.sh --auth oidc --db postgres -- up -d
```

**LDAP + MongoDB**:

```shell
bash compose.sh --auth ldap --db mongo -- up -d
```

**OpenTelemetry** (any base — here static + H2):

```shell
bash compose.sh --otel -- up -d
```

After a push through the proxy, traces are at the Jaeger UI (http://localhost:16686, service `fogwall`), metrics are
graphed in Grafana (http://localhost:3001, the "fogwall — Observability" dashboard, no login) and explorable directly in
Prometheus (http://localhost:9090), and the raw spans + metrics also stream to `docker compose logs otel-collector`.

### Auth provider details

#### Static auth

Log in at `http://localhost:8080` with `admin` / `admin` (defined in `docker/fogwall-local.yml`).

#### LDAP auth

Test accounts are defined in `docker/ldap-bootstrap.ldif`:

| Username   | Password      | LDAP email             |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| `testuser` | `testpass123` | `testuser@example.com` |
| `admin`    | `admin`       | `admin@example.com`    |

On first login the account is auto-provisioned and the LDAP `mail` attribute is stored as a locked email (not editable
from the profile UI). Inspect the `user_emails` table in Adminer or Mongo Express to see the `locked=true` row.

To add more users, edit `docker/ldap-bootstrap.ldif` and recreate the container:

```shell
bash compose.sh --auth ldap -- rm -sf openldap
bash compose.sh --auth ldap -- up -d openldap
```

#### OIDC auth

Uses [navikt/mock-oauth2-server](https://github.com/navikt/mock-oauth2-server), which accepts any username with no
password required.

**One-time `/etc/hosts` entry** — required so the OIDC issuer URL is the same from your browser and from fogwall inside
Docker:

```text
127.0.0.1  mock-oauth2
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and log in with any username.

### Proxy URLs

After `docker/gitea-setup.sh`, the test repository is reachable at:

```text
http://localhost:8080/server/gitea:3000/test-owner/test-repo.git
http://localhost:8080/proxy/gitea:3000/test-owner/test-repo.git
```

Clone example:

```shell
git clone http://fogwalladmin:Admin1234!@localhost:8080/server/gitea:3000/test-owner/test-repo.git
```

### Teardown

```bash
bash compose.sh [same --auth/--db flags as start] -- down -v
```

### Stack quirks that cost time if you don't know them

- **A container build reports `commit: unknown` unless you pass it in.** `BuildInfo` reads the commit from a resource
  Gradle expands at build time, and the builder image has no `git` binary, so a plain `docker build` (or
  `compose.sh -- build`) leaves it `unknown`. Export it if you need the local stack to name its commit —
  `BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) bash compose.sh -- build` — which the compose file forwards as a build argument.
  CI and the publish workflow already pass `github.sha`. A Gradle build on the host picks the commit up from
  `git rev-parse` on its own.
- **Podman + SELinux: the config profile silently does not load.** `docker/fogwall-docker-default.yml` is bind-mounted
  into the container and loaded off the classpath as a config profile, and a profile that cannot be read is skipped
  without an error. On an SELinux host the file is labeled `user_home_t`, the container is `container_t`, and the read
  is denied — so `providers.gitea` stays disabled and a clone through `/server/gitea:3000/...` returns
  `repository not found`. Confirm it by looking for `Loaded profile configuration from fogwall-docker-default.yml` in
  the startup log; if it is absent, the mount is unreadable. Fix it by swapping the `:ro` mount for the `:z` one
  commented out in `docker/docker-compose.yml`, which lets podman relabel the file. A one-off
  `chcon -t container_file_t docker/fogwall-docker-default.yml` also works, but a `restorecon` or a fresh clone undoes
  it.
- **`up -d` after a rebuild does not pick up the new image.** `bash compose.sh -- build` retags `fogwall:local`, but an
  existing container keeps running the old image — `up -d` reports success and changes nothing, so code changes appear
  not to take effect. Pass `--force-recreate`. That recreates Gitea too and resets its volume, so re-run
  `bash docker/gitea-setup.sh` afterwards or the seeded users, repos and tokens are gone (an invalid-token 401 from the
  Gitea API is the giveaway).
- **Server mode is interactive.** It holds the git session while the push waits for review, so anything pushing to
  `/server/…` blocks until you approve it in the dashboard.

## Code style

### Java

Formatting is enforced by [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) using palantir-java-format:

```shell
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

Formatting uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), lint checks use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). Both are Gradle tasks
that use the same Node binary as the build:

```shell
./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:npmFormat   # auto-format src/ with Prettier
./gradlew :fogwall-dashboard:npmLint     # ESLint check (fails on errors)
```

### Pre-commit hook

Install once after cloning:

```shell
./gradlew installGitHooks
```

This sets `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks/`. The hook runs on every `git commit`:

1. `spotlessApply` — auto-formats Java and re-stages changed files
2. `npmFormat` — auto-formats frontend source with Prettier and re-stages changed files
3. `npmLint` — ESLint check; fails the commit if there are errors (no auto-fix)

## Releases

Releases follow a two-phase process so every published image is identical to one CI already built and scanned. `main`
and each `release/X.Y.x` maintenance branch sit at a `-SNAPSHOT` version between releases.

**Phase 1 — release commit.** Strip `-SNAPSHOT` from `version` in `build.gradle` and set the chart's `appVersion`. On
`main` this goes up as a PR with auto-merge; on a `release/X.Y.x` branch it is pushed directly. Use the `/release`
Claude command.

**Phase 2 — tag.** Once the release commit is on its branch and its checks are green, push a signed annotated tag
(`v<version>`). The tag ruleset refuses the tag until the required checks have passed on that commit.
`release-publish.yml` then promotes that commit's `build-<sha>` images to the release tags — no rebuild occurs. Every
image is labelled `org.opencontainers.image.version` with the `build.gradle` version it was built from, and the
promotion is refused unless that label matches the tag. The release always gets `:X.Y.Z`; `:X.Y`, `:X` and `:latest`
move only when the release is at least as new as the image each points at now, so a patch on an older line never pulls
them backwards. Use the `/release-tag` Claude command, which also moves the branch to the next `-SNAPSHOT`.

### Documenting new config surface

When a PR introduces a new config section (not just a key on an existing one) in
[docs/configuration/index.md](docs/configuration/index.md), tag it with the release it's shipping in, e.g.
`_Available since v1.3.0._`, right under the heading. This isn't backfilled onto existing sections — only applied going
forward from a section's introduction.
